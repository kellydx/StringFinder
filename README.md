This program is designed to search for a word in a text file without using any method from prewritten classes
except for charAt()

and ask the user for a word to search for.
Then it will prompt a menu of:
1. Search for partial word and whole word
2. Search for whole word only
Then give them an option of whether case matters.
Report how many time that word is found 
and the line numbers where the word is found
